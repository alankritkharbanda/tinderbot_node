Namaste! 

I was inspired by an idea of my friend Harsh who started writing this bot. Most of the code here has been sourced from various bots previously written for Tinder. 

My aim here is to improve upon such available bots through extensive reverse engineering of Tinder API's.

At the moment, this bot can successfully fetch Tinder Profiles but like is not fully functional. I plan on adding analytics for profiles using standford nlp and face recognition algorithms in the future. An online viewer will be created alongside too.

To get the fb access token, simply use the url mentioned in urltoken.txt and after you click ok, view the access_token provided by fb in the response of 'confirm' file in the network logs.Will be automated soon.

Will update as more to this is developed.
